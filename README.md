## Distinctive features

### 1. Data model-driven

Most form-, table-, or process-driven no-code products create data structures directly in the user interface, such as Airtable, where adding a new column to a table is adding a new field. This has the advantage of simplicity of use, but the disadvantage of limited functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of more complex scenarios.

Rantir Cloud adopts the design idea of separating the data structure from the user interface, allowing you to create any number of blocks (data views) for the data collections, with different type, styles, content, and actions in each block. This balances the simplicity of no-code operation with the flexibility of native development.


### 2. What you see is what you get

Rantir Cloud enables the development of complex and distinctive business systems, but this does not mean that complex and specialized operations are required. With a single click, configuration options are displayed on the usage interface, and administrators with system configuration privileges can directly configure the user interface in a WYSIWYG manner.


### 3. Everything is implemented as plugins

Rantir Cloud adopts plugin architecture, all new functions can be realized by developing and installing plugins, and expanding the functions is as easy as installing an APP on your phone.

### 4. Rantir Enterprise or Self hosting

Based on Rantir's reseller and royalty agreement it is under USA, Colorado Law and protected with rigidity that you are not aloud to self host this without consent and an enterprise license.
